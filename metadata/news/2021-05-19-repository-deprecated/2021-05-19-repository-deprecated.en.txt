Starting with version 90.0.4430.212, www-client/chromium
is available directly in main ::gentoo repository for
ppc64le platform.
This repository is deprecated and not going to receive any
updates.

It is now safe to remove this repository from your system.

If you've followed default installation paths, you will need
to remove the following:
 /etc/portage/repos.conf/chromium-ppc64le.conf
 /var/db/repos/chromium-ppc64le

Next chromium update will come from main gentoo repository.
